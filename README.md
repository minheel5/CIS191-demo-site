CIS 191 Project 3
======


> This is a demo site that is a simplified version of the CIS 191 website. It is
used as a testbed/training ground for Git usage and merge conflict resolution.



**1.** When you push to the server, git hook copies the contents in the deploy branch to a public directory, ~/www, and runs the server in the background to deploy the website to the public.


**2.** ~/www gets pulished online


**3.** A bare repository is a repository that does not have a working tree, but it has all the contents of the .git subdirectory in the main directory.
